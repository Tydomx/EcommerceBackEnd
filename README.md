  ## Project Description: 
### The application is a back end server for an E-commerce website that allows the user to use latest technologies and add information into a database. The technologies used to create the app: Sequelize models to sync to MySQL database, Express API routes with CRUD, and dotenv to access the database from the machine. 
### Some issues with the app could potentially be a connection issue with the server not connecting to the MySQL if the log-in information isn't correct and JAWSDB hasn't overriden the local database.
### Future features to hopefully implement:
	Creating a front-end to connect to the back-end database

  ## Installation:
  ### Run the following command for this app to start:
	npm install
  ### After cloning the app onto your machine. Once the server has started the user will have to update the .env file to be able to access the MySQL from their local machine or the JAWSDB will be used for non-local. Now the user is able to add information to the database.

## Usage: 
### To start the server:
	npm run start
### Go to an api endpoint to grab all of the products available
	/api/products/
